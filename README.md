This is the source code for the game "Bullets and Brains" that I made a long back. The game is available now on https://velkur.itch.io/

Note: The Repository DO NOT contain any Animation files or sound files which I used in my game. If you want to use this source code then you might want to create new sound files and Animations according to the theme of your game.

Best Wishes.
